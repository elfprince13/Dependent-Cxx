# Dependent-Cxx

Deeply cursed experimental library that allocates a unique type for every variable in every distinct program trace, allowing you to create compile-time proofs about properties of runtime values (aka "dependent typing").

This is a proof of concept.
Things may be broken, undocumented, or not work as advertised.

Happy to accept PRs to make things better, especially:
- test suite
- cleaning up the algebra library
- finish the array demo
